# The Freeman Addiction Recovery Center - Donor Management System

In 2011, the Freeman Center for Addiction Recovery in Waco, TX needed a better way to manage donors and donations coming in. It took too much manpower to keep up with excel spreadsheet records going back decades. 

I volunteered to build a basic CakePHP system in my spare time to meet their need, and handed the site over to the Freeman Center in May 2011.
